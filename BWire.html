			<LI><B><I>Line Wire:</I></B><BR />This is made up of 3.05mm diameter high carbon steel wire, with a tensile strength of 170 to 180 kg/mm². The wire is drawn and dressed in such a manner that the coils formed will fall naturally into the specified diameter without forming a figure eight. Line wire is heavy hot dipped galvanized with minimum inc coating of 185 gm/mm2.</LI>
			<LI><B><I>Barbed Wire:</I></B><BR />This is 2.00mm diameter bright mild steel wire with a tensile strength of 38 to 55kg/mm² conforming to BS 1052. The wire is hot dipped galvanized with a minimum zinc coating of 20 to 50 gm/mm². The barbs are formed with four points. Spacing between the centers of the barbs of every 70mm along the length of the wire. The barbs are firmly secured by indentations made on the wire, so that the barbs do not rotate or slide along the wire. The four points of the barbs are formed at the right angles to one another and project outwards approximately 12mm from the center of the wire.</LI>
			<LI><B><I>Carrying Handles:</I></B><BR />Handles are made of mild steel wire of 3.55mm diameter and are attached to the outer turn of the coil on each side.</LI>
