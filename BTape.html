				Barbed Tapes are used as psychological and physical deterrent against intrusion by personnel and animals. Barbed tape barrier systems are more vicious and difficult to tamper with, providing superior perimeter security. Some of the users are military installations, nuclear energy sites, maximum security prisons, various petroleum installations, tank farms and other important industrial facilities.</span></TD>

			<DD>To give the maximum tensile strength at the time of the breach hard drawn steel cord is used (ES1). For camouflage purposes, a coaltar coating can be applied over the entire surface (ES-1), and to attain the high degree of rust resistance, the core wire is made of galvanized steel (ES-2). Any of the above three options are available to meet your specific requirements.</DD></DT></LI></P>

			<DD>The specification of the "ivory" tape is similar to those of ES types. The blades are sharper and have a greater pricking capacity. The life of this tape is more than three times longer than those of ES types. Therefore, "ivory" tape is a more effective choice in terrain which has heavy rain or in coastal areas. The diameter will be similar to ES type.</DD></DT></LI></P>
			<P><LI><DT><B><I>Long Blade Barbed Tape (LBBT):</I></B><BR />
			<DD>This is the most effective psychological and physical deterrent, ever made as a barrier obstacle. It is available in authentic stainless steel (SUS 430) and the core wire can be fabricated from either galvanized carbon steel or stainless steel.</DD></DT></LI></P>
